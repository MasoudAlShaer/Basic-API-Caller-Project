# Project Documentation: Postman and REST API  

## What is Postman?  
Postman is a tool designed to help developers test and work with APIs efficiently. It allows you to send HTTP requests to servers and view their responses in a simple interface. With Postman, you can test API functionality, troubleshoot issues, and document how APIs work. It’s especially useful for ensuring that endpoints behave as expected before they’re integrated into applications.  

### Features:  
- Test various HTTP methods like **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE**.  
- Add headers, parameters, or body data to requests.  
- Inspect responses, including status codes, headers, and returned data.  
- Automate testing with **Postman Collections** for repeated testing.

## What is a REST API?  
A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a way for software systems to communicate over the web. It follows a set of rules that make it easy to manage and exchange data. REST APIs use HTTP methods to perform actions on resources, such as retrieving, creating, or updating data. They are widely used because they are simple, scalable, and compatible with many programming languages.  

### Key Points About REST APIs:  
- **Stateless**: Each request is independent, meaning the server doesn’t keep track of previous interactions.  
- **Resource-Based**: REST APIs are organized around resources, identified by unique URLs.  
- **Standard Methods**:  
  - **GET**: Retrieve data.  
  - **POST**: Send data to create a resource.  
  - **PUT**: Update existing data.  
  - **DELETE**: Remove data.  
- **Data Formats**: Most REST APIs use **JSON** for data exchange but can support other formats like **XML**.  

REST APIs are an essential part of modern web development, making it possible for different systems and applications to communicate seamlessly.

This project uses **Postman** for API testing and follows the **REST API** structure to ensure clean and efficient communication between the client and server. More details can be found in the project files.
